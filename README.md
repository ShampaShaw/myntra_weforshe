# Myntra-Inspired Application

This is a combined application inspired by the Myntra app, featuring a chat room, chatbot, streaks, and rewards functionalities. The application is built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. The front-end is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

### Files

- `server.js`: The main server file that sets up the Express application, initializes Socket.io, and handles socket events.
- `public/code.js`: The client-side JavaScript file that handles user interactions and socket events.
- `public/index.html`: The HTML file that defines the structure of the chat application.
- `public/style.css`: The CSS file that styles the chat application.
- `package.json`: The file that lists the project's dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: The file you are reading, which provides an overview of the project.

## Features

1. **Chat Room**: A real-time chat room where users can join and exchange messages.
2. **Chatbot**: A fashion-related chatbot that provides the best possible answers using AI/ML.
3. **Community Room**: A place where users can exchange ideas about fashion and the latest trends.
4. **Streaks and Rewards**: Users are rewarded with discount coupons and gifts for regular logins. The streak count increases by 1 for each regular login, and rewards are given after completing a streak of a certain period set by Myntra.
